# ML-airport-taxi-in
The ML-airport-taxi-in software is developed to provide a reference implementation to serve as a research example how to train and register Machine Learning (ML) models intended for four distinct use cases: 1) unimpeded AMA taxi in, 2) unimpeded ramp taxi in, 3) impeded AMA taxi in, and 4) impeded ramp taxi in. The software is designed to point to databases which are not provided as part of the software release and thus this software is only intended to serve as an example of best practices. The software is built in python and leverages open-source libraries kedro, scikitlearn, MLFlow, and others. The software provides examples how to build three distinct pipelines for data query and save, data engineering, and data science. These pipelines enable scalable, repeatable, and maintainable development of ML models.
